Bienvenidos to the proceedings of the sixth edition of the workshop on computational approaches for linguistic code-switching (CALCS-2023)! 
Code-switching is a common phenomenon in the multilingual communities where multilingual speakers communicate by moving back and forth between the languages they speak when communicating with other multilingual speakers. 
This year the workshop is being held in Singapore on December 7th, 2023 at EMNLP. \\

This workshop series brings together experts and practitioners that are currently working on different aspects of code-switching with a special focus on motivating tighter collaborations between speech and text researchers. 
We received 15 regular workshop submissions, of which we accepted 8 and 1 non-archival. 
Our workshop also aims to motivate new research and energize the community to take on the challenges posed by code-switching data. \\

The workshop program includes short talks from regular workshop submissions and keynote speakers. 
We also have a stellar invited speaker program with a keynote talk by Preethi Jyothi and Haizhou Li. 
We would like to thank the EMNLP workshop organizers for their help during the organization of the workshop. 
It would have been great to see everyone face to face in Singapore and we hope that you join us on December 7th and that you enjoy the program we put together. \\ \\
