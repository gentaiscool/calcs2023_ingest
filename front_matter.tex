  \vspace*{0.5cm}
  Bienvenidos to the proceedings of the sixth edition of the workshop on computational approaches for linguistic code-switching (CALCS-2023)! 
Code-switching is a common phenomenon in the multilingual communities where multilingual speakers communicate by moving back and forth between the languages they speak when communicating with other multilingual speakers. 
This year the workshop is being held in Singapore on December 7th, 2023 at EMNLP. \\

This workshop series brings together experts and practitioners that are currently working on different aspects of code-switching with a special focus on motivating tighter collaborations between speech and text researchers. 
We received 15 regular workshop submissions, of which we accepted 8 and 1 non-archival. 
Our workshop also aims to motivate new research and energize the community to take on the challenges posed by code-switching data. \\
%

The workshop program includes short talks from regular workshop submissions and keynote speakers. 
We also have a stellar invited speaker program with a keynote talk by Preethi Jyothi and Haizhou Li. 
We would like to thank the EMNLP workshop organizers for their help during the organization of the workshop. 
It would have been great to see everyone face to face in Singapore and we hope that you join us on December 7th and that you enjoy the program we put together. \\ \\

Let’s talk code-switching in December! \\

    \textbf{Abstract:} Language modeling is the technique to estimate the probability of a sequence of words. A bilingual language model is expected to model the sequential dependency for words across languages, which is difficult due to the inherent lack of suitable training data as well as diverse syntactic structure across languages. We propose a bilingual attention language model (BALM) that simultaneously performs language modeling objective with a quasi-translation objective to model both the monolingual as well as the cross-lingual sequential dependency. The attention mechanism learns the bilingual context from a parallel corpus. We will discuss the study of multilingualism in South East Asia and how code-switch language models can be useful for language processing. \\

    \textbf{Abstract:} Code-switching, i.e., the linguistic phenomenon of switching between languages within and across sentences, is widely prevalent in multilingual societies. Code-switched inputs pose a serious challenge to existing speech and NLP models. The challenge mainly emerges due to the limited availability of natural code-switched data and the inherent diversity in code-switching. In this talk, we will discuss techniques that aim to effectively address these dual challenges. These techniques will cover how to exploit monolingual speech and text for code-switching, how to generate synthetic and diverse code-switched text to augment real data and how to judiciously use existing real code-switched speech and text in conjunction with other linguistic resources.\\
